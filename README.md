# ChatSapce - MERN APP

## Project Description
Our previous project, GhettoGroupo- a project management platform, had everything but a direct communication channel. ChatSpace aims at bridging this gap! ChatSpace is a communication platform where people can join/create channels and share messages with others.

## Key Features
Seamless Authentication: Users can login/logout without password requirements for known accounts in just one click!

Channels: Users can create new channels and communicate with others

Messages: Users can share messages with other users in the channel

EAD Feature: security feature using Firebase

## Test the project
Steps to Set Environment
Initially, make sure you have both npm and node.js installed on your device. To install all the dependencies, run the following in both the frontend and backend folders.

npm i

Globally install nodemon using the following command:

npm install -g nodemon

Steps to run the application
Open two terminals for both the frontend and backend at the respective folders and run nodemon in both terminals. The react server might take a while to load, but once it's done, you'll see a browser tab open with the application.

Now, sign in with your Google account, create/join channels and you can share real-time messages!
